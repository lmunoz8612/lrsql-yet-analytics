# SQL LRS Overview

### What is SQL LRS?

A Learning Record Store (LRS) is a persistent store for xAPI statements and associated attachments and documents. The full LRS specification can be found in Part 3 of the [xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md). SQL LRS is distinct from other LRSs developed at Yet Analytics for being SQL-based and supporting multiple SQL database management systems (DBMSs) like H2, SQLite, and Postgres.

### How to use SQL LRS?

SQL LRS Accounts can be created using the user interface (see [Getting Started](startup.md)) or API calls (see [Endpoints](endpoints.md)). Accounts can be used to create or access SQL LRS credentials. These credentials, which consist of an API key, a secret API key, and their scopes ([described in the xAPI spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#42-oauth-10-authorization-scope)), are then used as headers for LRS-specific methods to authenticate and authorize the request sender.

### Differences from Cloud LRS

If you previously used Yet's Cloud LRS products, it is important to be aware of certain differences:
- Tenancy is not supported in SQL LRS; the entire database can be considered to be a single default tenant.
- All operations in SQL LRS are synchronous; async operations are not supported.
- `stored` timestamps are not strictly monotonic in SQL LRS; two or more Statements may be assigned the same timestamp if stored in quick succession.
- If a Statement voids a target Statement that is itself voiding, SQL LRS will accept it upon insertion, though it will not update the state of the target Statement as per the [xAPI spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#214-voided-statements). (The Cloud LRS, on the other hand, will simply reject the voiding Statement.)
